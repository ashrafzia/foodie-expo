# 🍴 Foodie – Recipe App (Expo / React Native)

**Foodie** is a lightweight mobile app built with **React Native** and **Expo**.  
It lets users browse recipes, view details, save favorites, and even add their own dishes.  
Data is persisted locally using AsyncStorage, so your recipes and favorites stay saved.
